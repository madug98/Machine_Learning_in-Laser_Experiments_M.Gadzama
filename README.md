Investigations and tests into the use of the Gaussian Process provided by MLOOP: M. R. Hush, https://m-loop.readthedocs.io/en/ latest/api/mloop.html (2016). 
Various tests involve looking at how using the algorithm to obtain the parameters from experimental data, subjected to white Gaussian noise and Poisson noise (related to the case of low photon count experiment).
Correlations between parameters and obtained values at different SNR values explored.
