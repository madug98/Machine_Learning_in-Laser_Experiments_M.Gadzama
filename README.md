Masters Project: Using Machine Learning Techniques in order to Optimise Laser Experiments


Investigations and tests into the use of the Gaussian Process provided by MLOOP: M. R. Hush, https://m-loop.readthedocs.io/en/ latest/api/mloop.html (2016). 
Various tests involve looking at how using the algorithm to obtain the parameters from experimental data, subjected to white Gaussian noise and Poisson noise (related to the case of low photon count experiment).
Correlations between parameters and obtained values at different SNR values explored. 
These investigations are being used as part of research into optimising laser experiments. 'Experimental data' is synthetic but follows models pertaining to real experiments. 

Current Aim:
Investigation into the possiblility of using machine in experiments dominated by Poisson (shot) noise. Potential for obtaining parameters and signals at lower noise values compared to traditional iterative techniques, in a shorter period of time.
